    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce has become a major player in the retail landscape, especially in sectors like electronics, where online shopping has seen significant growth.\n",

This competition has driven changes in both the types of products offered and the functionalities of their respective platforms, shaping the way consumers interact with online shopping.\n",

    "\n",
    "By examining archived versions of these websites, we aim to track the changes in product offerings (with a focus on electronic devices like smartphones, laptops, and televisions) and investigate how the functionalities of these platforms have evolved to improve the customer experience.\n"
